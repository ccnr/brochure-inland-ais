# On the Rhine, what are the minimum requirements for electronic chart display systems?

[CCNR](www.ccr-zkr.org) passed [resolution](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/13020400-en.html) 2013-II-16 making it compulsory to possess and use the Inland AIS with effect from 1st December 2014. 

The [minimum requirements for Inland ECDIS devices in information mode and comparable devices](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/files/documents/ris/prot2014I12en_Annexe2.pdf) were adopted by [Resolution](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/13020400-en.html) 2014-I-12. 

It should be noted that, if appropriate, the competent authorities may lay down additional requirements beyond the minimum requirements for special functions.

The [document](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/files/documents/ris/prot2014I12en_Annexe2.pdf) contains mininum requirements for the use, the display of information and the software:
