# What is the advantage of using Inland AIS device for the boatmaster?

The information transmitted and received by the Inland AIS device displayed on electronic chart display systems does not exempt the boatmaster from monitoring traffic by means of the radar image and by looking out of the wheelhouse window.

Only vessels equipped with an Inland AIS device are visible on the display device and not all vessels are equipped with an Inland AIS device.

An Inland AIS device **in combination with an Inland ECDIS device** \(or a comparable electronic chart display device\) enable boatmasters:

* to **send regularly** their vessel’s name, position, speed and course to **vicinity vessels** possessing an Inland AIS on board
* to display on the screen electronic chart display system the name, position, in vicinity \(only the one possessing an Inland AIS device in working order\)
* to get some information to take necessary measures to **safely navigate** \(in combination with looking out of the window and input from other navigation devices\)

Although the radar also enables other surrounding vessels to be located, the radar’s useful range is nonetheless limited compared to that of the AIS device, especially in inland waters. Indeed, an Inland AIS device has a **far greater range and enables vessels** on the other side of a barrier, such as a mountain, to be displayed.

The Inland AIS device therefore provides the boatmaster with a **navigational aid. However, Inland AIS in combinaison with an** electronic chart display system is **not a navigation system** in the same way as is a radar.

The boatmasters must acquaint themselves with the information provided by the Inland AIS device and use it to ensure safe navigation and good order. This information must be used correctly in a way consistent with the boatmasters' “duty of vigilance”.
