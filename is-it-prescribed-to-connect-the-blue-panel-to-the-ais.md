# Is it prescribed  to connect the blue sign to the Inland AIS?

No, Connecting the blue sign to the AIS device is **not** prescribed.

If connected, connection from AIS to the blue sign shall work with high reliability and consequently should be installed by [authorized specialized firms](how-to-install-inland-nautical-equipment.md#list-of-approved-installing-firms).

Skippers shall be aware that not all vessels have connected the blue sign to AIS. This may result in a situation where the displayed information on the electronic chart does not necessarily correspond to the current situation.

It is recommended that manufacturer of Inland ECDIS equipment implement standardized symbols for the blue sign as proposed by  [Standard Inland ECDIS Edition 2.4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1558600108625&uri=CELEX:32018R1973). 

### The blue sign can have three different states \(represented with different symbols\):

* blue sign not connected to AIS,
* blue sign connected and set
* blue sign connected and not set
