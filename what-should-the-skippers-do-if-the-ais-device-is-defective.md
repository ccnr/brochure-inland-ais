# What should the skippers do if the Inland AIS device is defective ?

When in use the Inland AIS device must operate reliably and be in good working order. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
A defective AIS device will cause **misjudgements** between skippers and **unsafe situations** on the waterways. 
{% endhint %}

This is why defective Inland AIS devices must be repaired immediately or replaced by devices in good working order. No voyage should be commenced without an Inland AIS device in good working order and switched on. 

{% hint style="info" %}
In case  of malfunction, switching off and restarting \(**reboot**\) the Inland AIS device could help recover the good working order. 
{% endhint %}

As a defective AIS device should be the exception to the rule, the CCNR recommends that the riparian states of the Rhine apply the following flexibility rules:

* Navigation may be **continued for a maximum period of 48 hours** with an AIS device not transmitting data enabling vessels to reach the next port of loading or unloading or, failing that, if this port is too far away, a place where the defective devices can be repaired or replaced. The continuation of the voyage with a defective AIS device is under the full responsibility of the skipper
* **No voyage may be started** without an AIS device in good working order and operating
* Given the special nature of voyages undertaken by ferries and day-trip vessels, the two preceding paragraphs do not apply to these two types of vessel. For a ferry, navigation may be continued for a maximum period of 24 hours with an AIS device not transmitting data. For a daytrip vessel, navigation may be continued for a maximum period of 48 hours with an AIS device not transmitting data
* If the AIS device is no longer transmitting data, the vesselâ€™s skipper **will immediately notify the sector traffic centre** and will provide regular reports on the ship-to-ship channel until the AIS device is working again

If the Inland AIS device is defective it has to be repaired by an approved specialised firm.
