# What to do in the event of an electronic chart display system no longer able

The electronic chart display system shall operate reliably and be in good working order.

In case of malfunction, switching off and restarting the electronic chart display system and the Inland AIS device could help recover the good working order.

If the electronic chart display system is malfunctioning, this may cause misjudgements and uncertainty on the waterway.

A voyage undertaken with a defective Inland ECDIS device engages the responsibility of the skipper.

As a defective electronic chart display system should be the exception to the rule, the [CCNR](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/) recommends that the riparian states of the Rhine apply the following flexibility rules:

* Navigation may be continued for a maximum period of 48 hours with an electronic chart display system that does not allow Inland AIS device data to be displayed. This flexibility enables the next port of loading or unloading to be reached or, failing that, if this port is too far away, a place where repair or replacement of the defective devices can be affected.
* No voyage shall be commenced without an electronic chart display system in good working order and operating, failing which the 48-hour grace period would lapse.
* Given the special nature of voyages undertaken by day-trip vessels, the two preceding paragraphs do not apply to these vessels. For a day-trip vessel, navigation may be continued for a maximum period of 48 hours with an electronic chart display system that does not allow AIS device data to be displayed.
