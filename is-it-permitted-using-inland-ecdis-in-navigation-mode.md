# Is it permitted using Inland ECDIS in navigation mode?

Yes, Although Inland ECDIS in navigation mode is accepted to fulfill the obligation of equipment with Inland ECDIS in information mode or comparable electronic chart display systems, it is recommended to have beside the Inland ECDIS in navigation mode an additional and separate Inland ECDIS in information mode or a comparable electronic chart display system to prevent switching between different ranges in navigation mode.

The Inland ECDIS Standard defines two modes of operation:

* [Inland ECDIS in information mode](is-it-permitted-using-inland-ecdis-in-navigation-mode.md#operation-of-inland-ecdis-in-information-mode)
* [Inland ECDIS in navigation mode](is-it-permitted-using-inland-ecdis-in-navigation-mode.md#operation-of-inland-ecdis-in-navigation-mode)

## Operation of Inland ECDIS in information mode 

In the information mode, Inland ECDIS equipment acts as an electronic atlas ans serves to guide and to provide information about the waterway. It is not intended to navigate the vessel. 

When connected to a positioning sensor the chart picture can be adjusted automatically in a way that the ship's own position is fixed in the centre of the screen. It is also possible to display other vessels, which are equipped with Inland AIS, if the application is connected to an Inland AIS transponder.

For Inland ECDIS equipment and applications that are destined for the information mode only, the requirements of the Inland ECDIS Standard are to be understood as a recommendation.

Inland ECDIS in information mode is typical used in ranges of 2 000 m and more.

## Operation of Inland ECDIS in navigation mode

Navigation mode means the use of the Inland ECDIS for conning the vessel by using radar and underlaid chart image \(Inland ENC\). 

Inland ECDIS equipment being able to operate in the navigation mode means radar equipment as defined by the regulations concerning the minimum requirements and test conditions for radar installations used for Rhine navigation and requires type test and approval. The vesselâ€™s position must be derived from a continuous positioning system whose accuracy is consistent with the requirements of safe navigation. 

The position and heading determination must meet the requirements as defined in Section 4A, No. 2.1 of the standard. Anyone, who uses an Inland ECDIS device in the navigation mode, must have a radar license.

Inland ECDIS in navigation mode shall be operated in an appropriate radar range \(on river Rhine: typically 800 m / 1 200 m\).
