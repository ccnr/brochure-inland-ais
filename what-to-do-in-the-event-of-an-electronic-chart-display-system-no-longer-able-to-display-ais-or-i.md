# What should the skippers do if Inland ECDIS no longer displays AIS information?

The electronic chart display system shall operate reliably and be in good working order.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of malfunction, switching off and restarting the Inland ECDIS device and the Inland AIS device could help recover the good working order. 
{% endhint %}

If the electronic chart display system is malfunctioning, this may cause misjudgments and uncertainty on the waterway.

{% hint style="warning" %}
A voyage undertaken with a defective Inland ECDIS device engages the responsibility of the skipper.
{% endhint %}

As a defective electronic chart display system should be the exception to the rule, the [CCNR](www.ccr-zkr.org) recommends that the riparian states of the Rhine apply the following flexibility rules depending on the nature of the voyage:
