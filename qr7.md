# When is it compulsory to install Inland AIS device?

## Vessels obliged to be equipped with an Inland AIS device

The obligation of possession of an Inland AIS device is described in detail in article 4.07 of the [Rhine Vessel Inspection Regulations \(RVIR\).](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/12020200-en.html#03)

This obligation of equipment with an Inland AIS device applies to all vessels, including seagoing vessels, ferries, small police crafts equipped with a radar and small crafts in possession of an inspection certificate in accordance with the Rhine Vessel Inspection Regulations or a certificate deemed to be the equivalent of these regulations.

Only the vessels referred to below are not subject to this requirement.

## **Exempt vessels:**

The following vessels are not subject to an obligation of equipment with an Inland AIS device:

a\) Vessels in pushed convoys and side-by-side formations, except for the vessel providing the main means of propulsion,

b\) small crafts, except:

* police crafts with radar equipment, and
* vessels in possession of an inspection certificate in accordance with the Rhine Vessel Inspection Regulations or a certificate deemed to be the equivalent of these regulations,
* barges without their own means of propulsion,
* floating equipment without their own means of propulsion.

Mandatory use of the AIS device is explained in [What is mandatory using of the Inland AIS device?](qr17.md).

For the aforementioned vessels not subject to mandatory possession, it is recommended to use an approved Inland AIS device \(and not a Class A or B device\) as specified in the RVIR, as the Inland AIS device is designed to receive reports specifically intended for inland navigation.

However, for small recreational crafts, the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine \(CCNR\) recommends installing a class B AIS device.

Small crafts exempt from mandatory possession of an Inland AIS device must also, if they wish to install an AIS device, possess a radio-telephone system in good working order and switched to listening mode on the ship-to-ship network.

Definition : According to article 1.01 \(m\) of the Rhine Police Regulation, a small craft is a vessel whose maximum hull length, excluding rudder and bowsprit, is less than 20 m, unless it is:

* a vessel authorised to tow, push or propel side-by-side vessels that are not small crafts,
* a vessel authorised to carry more than 12 passengers,
* a ferry or,
* a barge

## **The specificity of certain vessels**

Like commercial navigation vessels, police vessels equipped with a radar also have to be in possession of an Inland AIS device although they are frequently “small crafts”.

Vessels belonging to the authorities usually possess an inspection certificate as required by the RVIR or a certificate deemed by these regulations to be equivalent. As such, they must also be equipped with an Inland AIS device.

## **Frequency allocation certificates**

All vessels in possession of an Inland AIS device or radar equipment or radio-telephone installation must carry on board the “frequency allocation certificate\(s\)” or “ship station licence” pursuant to article 1.10 \(l\) of the Rhine Police Regulations.

This request for a certificate or licence is to be made to the competent authorities as soon as the AIS device has been acquired. The skipper must ensure that the vessel’s owner or operator has made this request. In all cases it is the responsibility of the skipper to check that this certificate or licence is on board the vessel.

## **I want to install an Inland AIS device without being obliged to do so?**

For the aforementioned vessels not subject to mandatory possession, it is recommended to use an approved Inland AIS device \(and not a Class A or B device\), , as the Inland AIS device is designed to receive reports specifically intended for inland navigation. However, for small recreational crafts, the CCNR recommends installing a class B AIS device.

Small crafts \(and in particular recreational crafts\) that are not subject to mandatory possession of an AIS device and which decide to acquire a class B AIS device are not obliged to use an approved specialised firm to install this device. However, the CCNR recommends using an approved specialised firm to reduce the risk of malfunction.
