# Can a skipper install an Inland AIS device without being obliged to do so?

If the vessel has no obligation for Inland AIS equipment, it may equip with an:

| Equipment type | Recommandation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Class **B** AIS device  | recommended only for pleasure craft, considered as small craft |
| Class **A** AIS device | not recommended |
| **Inland** AIS device | recommended only for commercial vessels |

{% page-ref page="qr6.md" %}

In this case, the [CCNR](www.ccr-zkr.org) recommends for these vessels to **use an Inland AIS equipment** \(and not a Class A or B equipment\) with respect to the RVBR. **Except for pleasure craft** \(considered as small craft\) which may be better fitted with Class B AIS equipment.

{% hint style="info" %}
For vessels **with no obligation** of equipment, your Inland AIS equipment has to be set to the **listening** position for the vessel-to-vessel network.
