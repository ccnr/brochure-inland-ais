# What is the advantage of using AIS for the skipper?

The information displayed by the AIS device on electronic chart display systems does not exempt the skipper from monitoring traffic by means of the radar image and by looking out of the wheelhouse window.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only vessels equipped with an AIS device are visible on the display device and not all vessels are equipped with an AIS device.
{% endhint %}

An Inland AIS device **in combination with an Inland ECDIS device** \(or to a comparable electronic chart display device\) enable skippers:

* to **send regularly** their vessel’s name, position, speed and course to **vicinity vessels** possessing an Inland AIS on board
* to display on the ECDIS screen the name, position, speed and course of vessels in vicinity \(only the one possessing an Inland AIS device in working order\)
* to take necessary measures to **safely navigate** \(in combination with looking out of the window and input from other navigation devices\)

Although the radar also enables other surrounding vessels to be located, the radar’s useful range is nonetheless limited compared to that of the AIS device, especially in inland waters. Indeed, an Inland AIS device has a **far greater range and enables vessels** on the other side of a barrier, such as a mountain, to be displayed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The AIS device therefore provides the skipper with a **navigational aid**, but one which is **not a navigation system** in the same way as is a radar.
{% endhint %}

The skippers must acquaint themselves with the information provided by the AIS device and use it to ensure safe navigation and good order. This information must be used correctly  in a way consistent with the skippers' “duty of vigilance”.
