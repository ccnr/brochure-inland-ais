# What is mandatory using of the Inland AIS device?

## Principle: Inland AIS device must be permanently switched on

Within the scope of the [Rhine Police Regulation,](https://ccr-zkr.org/13020500-en.html#01) article 4.07 paragraph 2, the Inland AIS device must be permanently in operation.

{% hint style="info" %}
All Vessels carrying an Inland AIS \(even with no obligation\) have to keep it switched on permanently. 
{% endhint %}

### Derogations

The obligation to keep the Inland AIS device switched on at all times does not apply:

* to vessels and convoys in the overnight mooring ports of Haaften, IJzendoorn and Lobith \(although the CCNR recommends keeping the Inland AIS device switched on\)
* if the competent authority has granted a derogation for vessels navigating from the navigable channel to mooring infrastructure
* to police vessels, if the transmission of AIS data is likely to compromise policing tasks

The CCNR does however recommend keeping the AIS device switched on permanently and not to switch it off while the vessel is underway.
