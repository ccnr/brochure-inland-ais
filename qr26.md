# Is it prescribed to connect the blue sign to the Inland AIS?

Connecting the blue panel to the Inland AIS device **is not prescribed**.

The connection of the blue panel to the Inland AIS device is handled very differently. When going about their navigational duties, skippers must be aware that certain vessels have connected the blue panel to the Inland AIS device and others not, with the result that the situation displayed on the electronic chart does not necessarily correspond to the actual situation.
