### Operation of Inland ECDIS device in information mode

In the information mode, an Inland ECDIS device acts as an electronic atlas and serves to guide and to provide information about the waterway.

Inland ECDIS in information mode is typically used in ranges of 2 000 m and more.

### Operation of Inland ECDIS device in navigation mode

Navigation mode means the use of the Inland ECDIS device for conning the vessel by using radar and underlaid chart image \(Inland ENC\).

Inland ECDIS equipment being able to operate in the navigation mode means radar equipment as defined by the regulations concerning the minimum requirements and test conditions for radar installations used for Rhine navigation and requires type approval. The vesselâ€™s position must be derived from a continuous positioning system whose accuracy is consistent with the requirements of safe navigation.

Anyone, who uses an Inland ECDIS device in the navigation mode, must have a radar license.

Inland ECDIS in navigation mode shall be operated in an appropriate radar range \(on the Rhine: typically, 800 m / 1 200 m\).
