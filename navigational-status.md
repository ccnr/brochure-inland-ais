# What are all navigational statuses available on an Inland AIS device?

The navigational status set in the Inland AIS station shall represent the current status of a navigation of a vessel. Frequently used navigational status are “under way using engine \(no. 0\)”, “moored \(no. 5\)” or “at anchor \(no.1\)”. Other navigational statuses are not used in inland navigation but are commonly known in maritime navigation.

The navigational status is sent to other vessels but has also influence on the reporting interval of your own AIS device. That’s why the navigational status needs to be kept up to date all the time.

The transmission interval with navigational status set to “moored \(no. 5\)” and “at anchor \(no. 1\)” is 3 minutes but with navigational status set to “under way using engine \(no.0\)” it is 10 seconds.

## Can the navigational status automatically set on the AIS device?

Keeping the navigational status always up to date is a kind of cumbersome. That’s why some Inland ECDIS devises support the setting of the navigational status by a special reminder which appears on the ECDIS screen when the navigational status needs to be changed potentially with an automatic setting as well. However, the skipper needs to check the proposed setting of the navigational status anyway, a navigational status “moored” instead of “under way using engine” makes a difference eventually.
