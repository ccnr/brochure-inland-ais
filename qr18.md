# How to set a convoy or a towed convoy in the Inland AIS device ?

## Convoys

#### Pushed convoys and side-by-side formations

The vessel providing the main propulsion must have its Inland AIS device working and have the convoy data correctly entered. The other vessels belonging to the convoy must switch off their onboard Inland AIS devices.

**Important information for the boatmaster**

When the composition of the convoy changes, the data that is transmitted by Inland AIS device \(e.g. vessel type, dimensions\) must be changed manually.

## Towed convoys

In contrast to pushed convoys and side-by- side combinations, all vessels in a tug must have their Inland AIS device in operation. The dimensions that have to be entered into the Inland AIS device are those for the specific vessel, thus the tug-boat enters its own dimensions, which is also the case for every vessel towed separately.

The most common vessel types for tugs are the following:
