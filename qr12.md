# How to enter my voyage data in the Inland AIS device ?

River Information Services \(RIS\) can provide more data but the transmission of those data is not mandatory and can be input voluntarily. As transmitting additional data has often proved to be a source of confusion, it is recommended that only the mandatory data listed in QR10be transmitted and not to transmit additional data such as information on the vesselâ€™s voyage.

A very useful check list containing tasks to be performed before, during and after the voyage can be found here:

It is the responsability of the boatmaster to ensure that the Inland AIS device transmits data that is at all times **up to date**.
