# On the Rhine, what are the minimum requirements for electronic chart display systems?

[CCNR](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/) passed [resolution](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/13020400-en.html) 2013-II-16 making it compulsory to possess and use the Inland AIS device with effect from 1st December 2014.

Minimum requirements to be complied with have been defined so as to ensure correct operation of the Inland ECDIS device in information mode or a comparable electronic chart display device. Recommendations have been drawn up by way of addition.

The [minimum requirements for electronic chart display system](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/files/documents/ris/prot2014I12en_Annexe2.pdf) were adopted by [Resolution](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/13020400-en.html) 2014-I-12.

The [document](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/files/documents/ris/prot2014I12en_Annexe2.pdf) contains minimum requirements for the use, the display of information and the software:

Remark : Inland ECDIS in navigation mode means that the device is connected to a radar system, which limits the range, unless one continuously switches over while navigating, which is not desirable either.
