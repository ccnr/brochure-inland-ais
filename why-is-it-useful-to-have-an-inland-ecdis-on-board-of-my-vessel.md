# Why is it useful to have an Inland ECDIS on board of my vessel?

Inland ECDIS is a system for the display of electronic inland navigation charts and additional information. Its purpose is to contribute to the safety and efficiency of inland navigation and thus also to the protection of the environment. Inland ECDIS is used simultaneously to reduce the workload when navigating the vessel as compared to traditional navigation, and for information methods. Inland ECDIS also provides the basis for other River Information Services \(RIS\), e.g. [Inland AIS](qr2.md).

Inland AIS enables the communication from vessel to ship as well as from ship to shore and vice versa. With the help of shore based AIS repeater stations, even information from vessels out-of-sight can be received, especially in mountainous sections.

Only a dedicated electronic chart display system with a screen, large enough to show all relevant details, makes full use of the potential given in the combination of Inland AIS and chart display.

In addition, electronic chart display system may show alarms of connected devices like Inland AIS.
