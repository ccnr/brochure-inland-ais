# What is mandatory using of the Inland AIS device?

## Principle: Inland AIS device must be permanently switched on

Within the scope of the [Rhine Police Regulation,](https://ccr-zkr.org/13020500-en.html#01) article 4.07 paragraph 2, the Inland AIS device must be permanently in operation except for the derogations.

All vessels carrying an Inland AIS device with no carriage requirement are recommended to keep it switched on permanently.

## Derogations

The obligation to keep the Inland AIS device switched on at all times does not apply:

* to vessels and convoys in the overnight mooring ports of Haaften, IJzendoorn and Lobith \(although the CCNR recommends keeping the Inland AIS device switched on\)
* if the competent authority has granted a local derogation for the bodies of water separated from the navigable channel by infrastructure;
* to police vessels, if the transmission of AIS data is likely to compromise policing tasks
