# Which data is transmitted by the AIS device?

Data transmitted by the Inland AIS station must always be up to date, according to article 4.07 \(2\) of the Rhine Police Regulations. It is the boatmaster’s responsibility to ensure that all data transmitted by the AIS station matches the vessel’s or convoy’s current data.

Vessels fitted with Inland AIS device transmit and receive information on an automatic and periodical basis from other ships equipped with AIS device. The main information regards the vessel and its current nautical data:

* Identity of the vessel
* Its exact position
* Its course and speed
* Other ship-specific data

However some data must be entered manually by the boatmaster. The most prominent of which are :

* navigational status of the vessel \(e.g. under way, moored or at anchor\)
* Type of vessel / convoy
* Overall length and beam of the vessel / convoy

## **List of data that must be transmitted by the Inland AIS device**

There is a minimum set of data transmitted by the AIS station which needs to be available at all times and kept up to date.

The minimum data set of an Inland AIS station is according to article 4.07 \(4\) of the Rhine Police Regulations:

| Dataset | Description | When to update the data |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MMSI | Maritime Mobile Service Identity = AIS device identity | Each installation |
| Vessel name | Usual name of the Vessel on VHF channels | Each installation |
| Call sign | VHF radio call sign of the vessel | Each installation |
| Vessel type or convoy type | List of vessel and convoy | Each voyage |
| ENI | unique European vessel Identification Number \(ENI\) or, for seagoing vessels that have not been given an ENI number, the IMO number | Each installation |
| length | length overall of the vessel or convoy accurate to 0.1 m | Each voyage |
| breadth | Overall breadth of the vessel or convoy accurate to 0.1 m | Each voyage |
| reference point | reference point for the positional information aboard the vessel, accurate to 1 m, \(this is the position of the GPS antenna of the Inland AIS station\) see Annex 2. | Each voyage |
| GNSS position | Position of the vessel \(derived from GPS in WGS 84 coordinate system\) | Never \(automatic\) |
| Time | time indication of position determination by the electronic position location device | Never \(automatic\) |
| SOG | speed over ground | Never \(automatic\) |
| COG | course over ground | Never \(automatic\) |
| NavStat | Navigational status | Each Manoeuvre |

Inland AIS device can provide more data but this is not mandatory on the Rhine, and the data can be entered voluntarily.

As transmitting additional data has often proved to be a source of confusion, it is recommended that only the mandatory data listed above be transmitted and additional data such as information on the vessel’s voyage should not be transmitted.

The checklist in the link below contains a checklist contains tasks to be performed before, during and after the voyage including the change of convoy data if necessary.
