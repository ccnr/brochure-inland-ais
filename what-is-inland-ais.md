# What is Inland AIS ?

The Automatic Identification System \(AIS\) is a ship borne radio data system, exchanging static, dynamic and voyage related vessel data between equipped vessels and between equipped vessels and shore stations.

The Automatic Identification System \(AIS\) has been in operation for inland navigation since 2010. It is a technology inherited from maritime navigation. It is an automatic tracking system on board vessels that gathers and provides vessel information to other vessels and shore organisation such as river information service \(RIS\) centres. 

The transfer of AIS information is done via AIS transponders on board vessels. AIS transponders integrate electronic sensors such as a global positioning system \(GPS\) and a Very High Frequency \(VHF\) transceiver to capture up-to-date vessel real time positioning.
