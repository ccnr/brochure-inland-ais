# How to enter my voyage data in the Inland AIS device ?

River Information Services \(RIS\) can provide more data but those data are not mandatory and can be input voluntarily.  
As transmitting additional data has often proved to be a source of confusion, it is recommended that only the mandatory data listed above be transmitted and not to transmit additional data such as information on the vessel’s voyage.

A very useful check list containing tasks to be performed before, during and after the voyage can be found here:

{% hint style="info" %}
The Inland AIS device transmits data that is at all times **consistent** with the vessel’s or convoy’s current data.
{% endhint %}
