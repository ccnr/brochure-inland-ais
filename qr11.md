# Entering data in the Inland AIS device

The boatmaster must check some data transmitted by the Inland AIS device at least once before each voyage. For example, the setting of the convoy may change depending on the voyage.

When the convoy setting is changed, The boatmaster needs to update :

* Vessel or convoy type
* Position of the reference point \(GPS Antenna\)

{% page-ref page="qr20.md" %}

Check the position unit required by the Inland AIS device \(metres or decimetres for example\)

By way of an example, for a convoy with a breadth of 12.54 m, the boatmaster enters 12.6 m or 126 dm in the Inland AIS device, depending on the unit required by the device.

For vessels that never sail in a convoy, the position of the reference point are entered by the approved specialised firm one for good during installation of the device.

## For convoys :

### Data automatically determined by the Inland AIS device

The boatmaster does not need to make any adjustments to the Inland AIS device for the data that are determined and transmitted automatically. These data are as follow :

* position \(WGS84 coordinates\) of the vessel or convoy on which the Inland AIS device is installed,
* speed over ground,
* course over ground,
* time indicated by the electronic position location device.

### Settings defined during installation of the Inland AIS device

These settings must be amended following a modification of the vessel \(example: change of owner of the vessel, change of name of the vessel, lengthening of the vessel\)

The settings listed below is entered when the Inland AIS device is installed. This initial setting \(and any subsequent amendment\) must be carried out by an approved specialised firm. However, the boatmaster must ensure that the approved specialised firm enters the data correctly:

* AIS station identity \(MMSI\)
* vessel name
* call sign \(VHF radio identification of the vessel\)
* unique European vessel Identification Number \(ENI\)
* overall length of the vessel referred to the on-board GPS antenna, accurate to 0.1 m, see [How do I set the Reference point for the positional information aboard the vessel?](qr20.md)
* overall breadth of the vessel referred to the on-board GPS antenna, accurate to 0.1 m, see [How do I set the Reference point for the positional information aboard the vessel?](qr20.md)

### Transmitting of incorrect data by the Inland AIS device

The boatmaster should regularly check if the transmitted data by the Inland AIS device are correct. This can be done by reviewing the settings in the appropriate menus of the Inland AIS device \(refer to the user manual of the Inland AIS device\).

In rare cases the Inland AIS device can transmit incorrect data without the boatmaster being aware of it. Consequently, the CCNR recommends that other boatmasters take the initiative in contacting the boatmaster of the vessel whose Inland AIS device is transmitting incorrect data to alert him.

The boatmaster must immediately correct the data or initiate a correction by the approved specialised firm. Failure to act on this request shall render him liable to prosecution.
