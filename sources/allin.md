Information document for Inland AIS device, Inland ECDIS device or a comparable device for displaying electronic charts

## QR1 Introduction - Inland AIS device on the Rhine

On the Rhine, the obligation to install and use an Inland AIS device connected to electronic chart display systems came into force on 1 December 2014.

When this document uses the expression “electronic chart display system” it is referring either to:

* an Inland ECDIS device in information mode
* or a comparable device for displaying electronic charts.

![](../.gitbook/assets/0%20%282%29.png)

Between 2016 and 2017, the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine \([CCNR](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/)\) conducted a survey among boatmaster\(s\), authorities and installation firms. The main result of the survey was that Inland AIS device \(in combination with an electronic chart display system\) is widely accepted as a supporting tool for a safer navigation on the Rhine.

This document, intended for crew members, aims to clarify the importance and correct usage of Inland AIS device in combination with an electronic chart display system by answering concrete questions raised by users in the survey.

The CCNR document “Clarifications concerning the obligation of equipment with an Inland AIS and an Inland ECDIS device or a comparable electronic chart display device”[\[1\]]() \(available in English, French, German and Dutch[\[2\]]()\) clarifies the obligation and the usage of the Inland AIS device and electronic chart display systems.

## [QR2](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LzkduvER3ZWneEYq38_%2F-M-A0UK4Y60-786Wre9p%2F-M-A2zVb76JfMs6KLkSv%2FbrochureAIS_en.pdf?alt=media&token=a68609d5-0041-484b-b784-6c66cb2420ad%22%20\t%20%22_blank) What is an Inland AIS device?

The Automatic Identification System \(AIS\) device is a transponder providing automatic communication and identification system intended to improve the safety of navigation by assisting in the efficient operation of vessel traffic services \(VTS\), ship reporting, ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore operations. The Automatic Identification System \(AIS\) has been first used for maritime navigation and is now in operation for inland navigation since 2010 on the Rhine. It is an automatic tracking system on board vessels that provides vessel information to other vessels and to shore organisation such as river information service \(RIS\) centres. Reversely, the AIS device also gathers information from other vessels and shore organisations.

The transfer of information is done via Inland AIS devices on board vessels. Inland AIS devices integrate electronic sensors such as a global positioning system \(GPS\), to capture real-time positioning of vessel, and a Very High Frequency \(VHF\) transceiver, to transmit data in both directions.

## QR3 How to install an Inland AIS device?

Boatmasters **cannot install** Inland AIS device. Inland AIS device must be installed by authorized specialized firms \(installation firms\).

### List of approved installation firms

The list of installation firms is available on a dedicated page of [CESNI](https://listes.cesni.eu/5000-en.html) can be consulted below

[Lists of approved authorities, firms,](https://listes.cesni.eu/5000-en.html%22%20/t%20%22_blank) [installation](https://listes.cesni.eu/5000-en.html%22%20/t%20%22_blank)[s and equipment in the field of technical requirements for inland navigation vessels.](https://listes.cesni.eu/5000-en.html%22%20/t%20%22_blank)

[Register of type-approved equipment, competent authorities for issuing type approvals, approved technical services and approved specialist](https://listes.cesni.eu/5000-en.html%22%20/t%20%22_blank) [firm](https://listes.cesni.eu/5000-en.html%22%20/t%20%22_blank)[s](https://listes.cesni.eu/5000-en.html%22%20/t%20%22_blank)

[listes.cesni.eu](https://listes.cesni.eu/5000-en.html%22%20/t%20%22_blank)

If it is compulsory for some vessel to be equipped with an Inland AIS device with a type approval. This means that only one of the devices out of the above list has to be used.

If your vessel is obliged to be equipped with an inland AIS, , only Inland AIS device marked with “**Installation permitted**” is allowed.

## QR4 What should the boatmasters do if the Inland AIS device is defective?

When in use the Inland AIS device must operate reliably and be in good working order.

A defective Inland AIS device will cause **misjudgements** between boatmasters and **unsafe situations** on the waterways.

This is why defective Inland AIS device must be repaired immediately or replaced by devices in good working order. No voyage may be started without an Inland AIS device in good working order and switched on.

In case of malfunction, switching off and restarting \(reboot\) the Inland AIS device could help recover the good working order.

A default can occur on an Inland AIS device. In this case, the CCNR recommends that the riparian states of the Rhine apply the following flexibility rules:

* Navigation may be **continued for a maximum period of 48 hours** with an Inland AIS device not transmitting data, enabling vessels to reach the next port of loading or unloading or, failing that, if this port is too far away, a place where the defective device can be repaired or replaced. The continuation of the voyage with a defective Inland AIS device is under the full responsibility of the boatmaster
* **No voyage may be started** without an Inland AIS device in good working order and operating
* Given the special nature of voyages undertaken by ferries and day-trip vessels, the two preceding paragraphs do not apply to these two types of vessel. For a ferry, navigation may be continued for a maximum period of 24 hours with an Inland AIS device not transmitting data. For a daytrip vessel, navigation may be continued for a maximum period of 48 hours with an Inland AIS device not transmitting data
* If the Inland AIS device is no longer transmitting data, the vessel’s boatmaster **will immediately notify by radio the sector traffic centre** and will provide regular reports on the ship-to-ship VHF channel until the Inland AIS device is working again

If the Inland AIS device is defective it has to be repaired by an approved specialised firm \(installation firm\).

## QR5 What is the advantage of using Inland AIS device for the boatmaster?

The information transmitted and received by the Inland AIS device displayed on electronic chart display systems does not exempt the boatmaster from monitoring traffic by means of the radar image and by looking out of the wheelhouse window.

Only vessels equipped with an Inland AIS device are visible on the display device and not all vessels are equipped with an Inland AIS device.

An Inland AIS device **in combination with an Inland ECDIS device** \(or a comparable electronic chart display device\) enable boatmasters:

* to **send regularly** their vessel’s name, position, speed and course to **vicinity vessels** possessing an Inland AIS on board
* to display on the screen electronic chart display system the name, position, in vicinity \(only the one possessing an Inland AIS device in working order\)
* to get some information to take necessary measures to **safely navigate** \(in combination with looking out of the window and input from other navigation devices\)

Although the radar also enables other surrounding vessels to be located, the radar’s useful range is nonetheless limited compared to that of the AIS device, especially in inland waters. Indeed, an Inland AIS device has a **far greater range and enables vessels** on the other side of a barrier, such as a mountain, to be displayed.

The Inland AIS device therefore provides the boatmaster with a **navigational aid. However, Inland AIS in combinaison with an** electronic chart display system is **not a navigation system** in the same way as is a radar.

The boatmasters must acquaint themselves with the information provided by the Inland AIS device and use it to ensure safe navigation and good order. This information must be used correctly in a way consistent with the boatmasters' “duty of vigilance”.

## QR6 What are the different types of AIS devices ?

In general, three types of AIS devices exist :

* **​inland AIS device​**
* ​class A AIS device​
* ​class B AIS device​

### Inland AIS devices

A vessel navigating on the Rhine falling under the carriage requirement of Inland AIS device \(see item QR7\) must be equipped with a type approved Inland AIS device.

Type approved means that the Inland AIS device must comply with the requirements of the Test Standard for Inland AIS, Compliance is certified by an examination of type approval by a competent authority.

These vessels navigating on the Rhine shall be equipped with Inland AIS devices having a type approval. Following rules apply regarding the edition of the Test standard inland AIS to comply with

* Inland AIS devices certified prior to 19 October 2012 must comply with the requirements of the CCNR’s Test Standard Edition 1.0 or 1.01 and devices certified after this date must comply with the requirements of the CCNR’s Test Standard Edition 2.0. Type approved Inland AIS devices according to Ed 1.0 or 1.01 are labelled with a **type approval** number assigned by the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine \(CCNR\) in the following format: R-4-2XX \(X represents a digit\)
* It was allowed to install Inland AIS equipment with a type approval in line with Edition 1.0 and 1.01 until 30 November 2015. They may be used after this date.
* With effect from 1 December 2015, only Inland AIS devices with a type-approval complying with the requirements of Test standard inland AIS 2017/Ed 2.0 of the Test Standard may be installed. Type approved Inland AIS devices according to Ed 2.0 are labelled with a **type approval** number assigned by the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine \(CCNR\) in the following format: R-4-3XX \(X represents a digit\)

It is expected with effect from 1 January 2024, that only Inland AIS devices with a type-approval in line with Edition 3.0 of the Test Standard Inland AIS may be installed. The already installed devices may be used after this date. Indeed, after the 1st of January 2022 \(planned date of the entry into force of the ES-TRIN 2021/1\), the ‘Test Standard for Inland AIS 2021/Ed 3.0 shall be used.

### Class A AIS devices

Class A AIS devices must satisfy IMO requirements \(International Maritime Organization\).Class A AIS device is widely used in maritime navigation.

A vessel navigating on the Rhine falling under the carriage requirement of Inland AIS device \(see item QR7\) cannot be equipped only with a Class A AIS device.

### Class B AIS devices

Class B AIS devices have limited functionality in comparison to Class A AIS device. Class B AIS device can be used by e.g. pleasure crafts. Class B AIS devices must comply with:

* the relevant requirements of Recommendation [ITU-R.M 1371](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1371/en) of Directive 2014/53/EU \(RED\),
* the international standard [IEC 62287-1 or 2](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/32705) \(including DSC channel management\).

QR7. When is it compulsory to install Inland AIS device?

### QR7.1 Vessels obliged to be equipped with an Inland AIS device

The obligation of possession of an Inland AIS device is described in detail in article 4.07 of the [Rhine Vessel Inspection Regulations \(RVIR\).](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/12020200-en.html#03)

This obligation of equipment with an Inland AIS device applies to all vessels, including seagoing vessels, ferries, small police crafts equipped with a radar and small crafts in possession of an inspection certificate in accordance with the Rhine Vessel Inspection Regulations or a certificate deemed to be the equivalent of these regulations.

Only the vessels referred to below are not subject to this requirement.

**QR7.2 Exempt vessels:**

The following vessels are not subject to an obligation of equipment with an Inland AIS device:

a\) Vessels in pushed convoys and side-by-side formations, except for the vessel providing the main means of propulsion,

b\) small crafts, except:

* police crafts with radar equipment, and
* vessels in possession of an inspection certificate in accordance with the Rhine Vessel Inspection Regulations or a certificate deemed to be the equivalent of these regulations,
* barges without their own means of propulsion,
* floating equipment without their own means of propulsion.

Mandatory use of the AIS device is explained in QR17 of this document.

For the aforementioned vessels not subject to mandatory possession, it is recommended to use an approved Inland AIS device \(and not a Class A or B device\) as specified in the RVIR, as the Inland AIS device is designed to receive reports specifically intended for inland navigation.

However, for small recreational crafts, the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine \(CCNR\) recommends installing a class B AIS device.

Small crafts exempt from mandatory possession of an Inland AIS device must also, if they wish to install an AIS device, possess a radio-telephone system in good working order and switched to listening mode on the ship-to-ship network.

Definition : According to article 1.01, \(m\) of the Rhine Police Regulation, a small craft is a vessel whose maximum hull length, excluding rudder and bowsprit, is less than 20 m, unless it is:

* a vessel authorised to tow, push or propel side-by-side vessels that are not small crafts,
* a vessel authorised to carry more than 12 passengers,
* a ferry or,
* a barge

**QR7.3 The specificity of certain vessels**

Like commercial navigation vessels, police vessels equipped with a radar also have to be in possession of an Inland AIS device although they are frequently “small crafts”.

Vessels belonging to the authorities usually possess an inspection certificate as required by the RVIR or a certificate deemed by these regulations to be equivalent. As such, they must also be equipped with an Inland AIS device.

**QR7.4 Frequency allocation certificates**

All vessels in possession of an Inland AIS device or radar equipment or radio-telephone installation must carry on board the “frequency allocation certificate\(s\)” or “ship station licence” pursuant to article 1.10 \(l\) of the Rhine Police Regulations.

This request for a certificate or licence is to be made to the competent authorities as soon as the AIS device has been acquired. The skipper must ensure that the vessel’s owner or operator has made this request. In all cases it is the responsibility of the skipper to check that this certificate or licence is on board the vessel.

QR**7.5 I want to install an Inland AIS device without being obliged to do so?**

For the aforementioned vessels not subject to mandatory possession, it is recommended to use an approved Inland AIS device \(and not a Class A or B device\), , as the Inland AIS device is designed to receive reports specifically intended for inland navigation. However, for small recreational crafts, the CCNR recommends installing a class B AIS device.

Small crafts \(and in particular recreational crafts\) that are not subject to mandatory possession of an AIS device and which decide to acquire a class B AIS device are not obliged to use an approved specialised firm to install this device. However, the CCNR recommends using an approved specialised firm to reduce the risk of malfunction.

## QR10 Which data is transmitted by the AIS device?

Data transmitted by the Inland AIS station must always be up to date, according to article 4.07 \(2\) of the Rhine Police Regulations. It is the boatmaster’s responsibility to ensure that all data transmitted by the AIS station matches the vessel’s or convoy’s current data.

Vessels fitted with Inland AIS device transmit and receive information on an automatic and periodical basis from other ships equipped with AIS device. The main information regards the vessel and its current nautical data:

* Identity of the vessel
* Its exact position
* Its course and speed
* Other ship-specific data

However some data must be enterred manually by the boatmaster. The most prominent of which are :

* navigational status of the vessel \(e.g. under way, moored or at anchor\)
* Type of vessel / convoy
* Overall length and beam of the vessel / convoy

[What are all navigational statuses available on an Inland AIS device?](https://ris.gitbook.io/ebrochure-iais/navigational-status)

[/](https://ris.gitbook.io/ebrochure-iais/navigational-status)[navigational-statu](https://ris.gitbook.io/ebrochure-iais/navigational-status)[s](https://ris.gitbook.io/ebrochure-iais/navigational-status)

**List of data that must be transmitted by the Inland AIS device**

There is a minimum set of data transmitted by the AIS station which needs to be available at all times and kept up to date.

The minimum data set of an Inland AIS station is according to article 4.07 \(4\) of the Rhine Police Regulations:

| Dataset | Description | When to update the data |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MMSI | Maritime Mobile Service Identity = AIS device identity | Each installation |
| Vessel name | Usual name of the Vessel on VHF channels | Each installation |
| Call sign | VHF radio call sign of the vessel | Each installation |
| Vessel type or convoy type | List of vessel and convoy | Each voyage |
| ENI | unique European vessel Identification Number \(ENI\) or, for seagoing vessels that have not been given an ENI number, the IMO number | Each installation |
| length | length overall of the vessel or convoy accurate to 0.1 m | Each voyage |
| breadth | Overall breadth of the vessel or convoy accurate to 0.1 m | Each voyage |
| reference point | reference point for the positional information aboard the vessel, accurate to 1 m, \(this is the position of the GPS antenna of the Inland AIS station\) see Annex 2. | Each voyage |
| GNSS position | Position of the vessel \(derived from GPS in WGS 84 coordinate system\) | Never \(automatic\) |
| Time | time indication of position determination by the electronic position location device | Never \(automatic\) |
| SOG | speed over ground | Never \(automatic\) |
| COG | course over ground | Never \(automatic\) |
| NavStat | Navigational status | Each Manoeuvre |

Inland AIS device can provide more data but this is not mandatory on the Rhine, and the data can be entered voluntarily.

As transmitting additional data has often proved to be a source of confusion, it is recommended that only the mandatory data listed above be transmitted and additional data such as information on the vessel’s voyage should not be transmitted.

The checklist in the link below contains a checklist contains tasks to be performed before, during and after the voyage including the change of convoy data if necessary.

## QR11 Entering data in the Inland AIS device

The boatmaster must check some data transmitted by the Inland AIS device at least once before each voyage. For example, the setting of the convoy may change depending on the voyage.

When the convoy setting is changed, The boatmaster needs to update :

* Vessel or convoy type
* Position of the reference point \(GPS Antenna\)

[How do I set the Reference point for the positional information aboard the vessel?](https://ris.gitbook.io/ebrochure-iais/reference-point-for-the-positional-information)

[/reference-point-for-the-positional-information](https://ris.gitbook.io/ebrochure-iais/reference-point-for-the-positional-information)

Check the position unit required by the Inland AIS device \(metres or decimetres for example\)

By way of an example, for a convoy with a breadth of 12.54 m, the boatmaster enters 12.6 m or 126 dm in the Inland AIS device, depending on the unit required by the device.

For vessels that never sail in a convoy, the position of the reference point are entered by the approved specialised firm one for good during installation of the device.

### For convoys :

### Data automatically determined by the Inland AIS device

The boatmaster does not need to make any adjustments to the Inland AIS device for the data that are determined and transmitted automatically. These data are as follow :

* position \(WGS84 coordinates\) of the vessel or convoy on which the Inland AIS device is installed,
* speed over ground,
* course over ground,
* time indicated by the electronic position location device.

### Settings defined during installation of the Inland AIS device

These settings must be amended following a modification of the vessel \(example: change of owner of the vessel, change of name of the vessel, lengthening of the vessel\)

The settings listed below is entered when the Inland AIS device is installed. This initial setting \(and any subsequent amendment\) must be carried out by an approved specialised firm. However, the boatmaster must ensure that the approved specialised firm enters the data correctly:

* AIS station identity \(MMSI\)
* vessel name
* call sign \(VHF radio identification of the vessel\)
* unique European vessel Identification Number \(ENI\)
* overall length of the vessel referred to the on-board GPS antenna, accurate to 0.1 m, see Annex 2
* overall breadth of the vessel referred to the on-board GPS antenna, accurate to 0.1 m, see Annex 2

### Transmitting of incorrect data by the Inland AIS device

The boatmaster should regularly check if the transmitted data by the Inland AIS device are correct. This can be done by reviewing the settings in the appropriate menus of the Inland AIS device \(refer to the user manual of the Inland AIS device\).

In rare cases the Inland AIS device can transmit incorrect data without the boatmaster being aware of it. Consequently, the CCNR recommends that other boatmasters take the initiative in contacting the boatmaster of the vessel whose Inland AIS device is transmitting incorrect data to alert him.

The boatmaster must immediately correct the data or initiate a correction by the approved specialised firm. Failure to act on this request shall render him liable to prosecution.

## QR12 How to enter my voyage data in the Inland AIS device ?

River Information Services \(RIS\) can provide more data but the transmission of those data is not mandatory and can be input voluntarily. As transmitting additional data has often proved to be a source of confusion, it is recommended that only the mandatory data listed in QR10be transmitted and not to transmit additional data such as information on the vessel’s voyage.

A very useful check list containing tasks to be performed before, during and after the voyage can be found here:

[Voyage-Checklist](https://ris.gitbook.io/ebrochure-iais/voyage-checklist)

[/voyage-checklist](https://ris.gitbook.io/ebrochure-iais/voyage-checklist)

It is the responsability of the boatmaster to ensure that the Inland AIS device transmits data that is at all times **up to date**.

## QR13 How to check that transmitted Inland AIS data is correct ?

The boatmaster should be aware of the data transmitted by the Inland AIS device in order to check if the data is correct according to the current situation. There are several possibilities to carry out this check:

* Check if the antenna is in upright position.
* Check the settings in the Inland AIS device. There are different menus to set, change and check Inland AIS transmitted data in the integral display of the Inland AIS device \(the so-called MKD- Minimum Keyboard Display\). Please refer to the manufacturer’s Inland AIS device operation manual for further details.
* Check the settings in the Inland ECDIS device. Many Inland ECDIS providers offer the possibility to set, change and check Inland AIS transmitted data in their Inland ECDIS Display. Boatmaster can ask their Inland ECDIS provider for the possibilities. Depending on the comparable electronic chart display device this check of settings can also be available on the device, if not the settings check can be done directly on the Inland AIS device.
* Check the settings by calling a RIS centre. Most of the RIS centres have a complete overview of the received AIS data. By contacting them via VHF or telephone, a validation check can be conducted.
* Check the transmitted data by asking another boatmaster. Every vessel equipped with an Inland AIS device can receive the transmitted data from other vessels. You might ask another boatmaster which information they receive about your vessel.

### Check the alarm status and the sensor status of the Inland AIS device

The Inland AIS device gives an alarm and sensor status if something is wrong either with the device or the connected sensors \(ie. GNSS sensor, Antenna\). By checking the statuses regularly, a problem might be noticed at an early stage. The code of the alarm gives an indication about the issue

The alarm statuses are helpful to report to the installer firm to make the right diagnostic.

### Installation on board vessels carrying dangerous goods

The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Inland Waterways \(ADN\) entered into force on 29 February 2008. The technical requirements applicable to the carriage of dangerous goods contains provisions for the installation of Inland AIS device on-boards vessels:

For **tank vessels**, there are different requirements for the position of the Inland AIS antenna. No part of an antenna for an electronic device must be situated above the cargo area and no part of a VHF antenna for an Inland AIS device can be within 2 meters of the cargo area.

### Installation of a second-hand Inland AIS device

A specialised firm approved by a competent authority can also install second-hand Inland AIS devices. This ensures that all the relevant data are correctly updated.

The Inland AIS device’s MMSI number is linked to the vessel. To install a second-hand Inland AIS device a new MMSI number is required. The competent authorities assign a new MMSI number when the Inland AIS device is installed in another vessel.

### Testing the Inland AIS device

The correct installation of the AIS device is ensured by the final test. The approved specialized firms shall conduct this test.

### Type approval of Inland AIS device

Inland AIS device must comply with the requirements of the Test Standard for Inland AIS, Compliance is certified by an examination of type approval by a competent authority.

* It was allowed to install Inland AIS equipment with a type approval in line with Edition 1.0 and 1.01 until 30 November 2015. They may be used after this date. With effect from 1 December 2015, only Inland AIS devices with a type-approval complying with the requirements of Test standard inland AIS 2017/Ed 2.0 of the Test Standard may be installed. Type approved Inland AIS devices according to Ed 2.0 are labelled with a **type approval** number assigned by the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine \(CCNR\) in the following format: R-4-3XX \(X represents a digit\)
* It is expected with effect from 1 January 2024, that only Inland AIS devices with a type-approval in line with Edition 3.0 of the Test Standard Inland AIS may be installed. The already installed devices may be used after this date. Indeed, after the 1st of January 2022 \(planned date of the entry into force of the ES-TRIN 2021/1\), the ‘Test Standard for Inland AIS 2021/Ed 3.0 shall be used.

## QR17 What is mandatory using of the Inland AIS device?

### Principle: Inland AIS device must be permanently switched on

Within the scope of the [Rhine Police Regulation,](https://ccr-zkr.org/13020500-en.html#01) article 4.07 paragraph 2, the Inland AIS device must be permanently in operation except for the derogations.

All vessels carrying an Inland AIS device with no carriage requirement are recommended to keep it switched on permanently.

### Derogations

The obligation to keep the Inland AIS device switched on at all times does not apply:

* to vessels and convoys in the overnight mooring ports of Haaften, IJzendoorn and Lobith \(although the CCNR recommends keeping the Inland AIS device switched on\)
* if the competent authority has granted a local derogation for the bodies of water separated from the navigable channel by infrastructure;
* to police vessels, if the transmission of AIS data is likely to compromise policing tasks

## QR18 How to set a convoy or a towed convoy in the Inland AIS device ?

### Convoys

#### QR18-1 Pushed convoys and side-by-side formations

The vessel providing the main propulsion must have its Inland AIS device working and have the convoy data correctly entered. The other vessels belonging to the convoy must switch off their onboard Inland AIS devices.

**Important information for the boatmaster**

When the composition of the convoy changes, the data that is transmitted by Inland AIS device \(e.g. vessel type, dimensions\) must be changed manually.

Codes for Types of Means of Transport

#### QR18-2 Towed convoys

In contrast to pushed convoys and side-by- side combinations, all vessels in a tug must have their Inland AIS device in operation. The dimensions that have to be entered into the Inland AIS device are those for the specific vessel, thus the tug-boat enters its own dimensions, which is also the case for every vessel towed separately.

The most common vessel types for tugs are the following:

## QR19 What are all navigational statuses available on an Inland AIS device?

The navigation status - as part of mandatory data element - must always be up to date, according to article 4.07 \(2\) of the Rhine Police Regulations.

The navigational status set in the Inland AIS device shall represent the current status of a navigation of a vessel. Frequently used navigational status are “under way using engine \(no. 0\)”, “moored \(no. 5\)” or “at anchor \(no.1\)”. The navigation statuses “restricted manoeuvrability” and “constrained by draught” are used when those specific navigation situations are met. Other navigational statuses are not used in inland navigation but are commonly known in maritime navigation.

The navigational status is sent to other vessels but has also influence on the reporting interval of your own AIS device. That’s why the navigational status needs to be kept up to date all the time.

The transmission interval with navigational status set to “moored \(no. 5\)” and “at anchor \(no. 1\)” is 3 minutes but with navigational status set to “under way using engine \(no.0\)” it is 10 seconds.

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | under way using engine |
| 1 | at anchor |
| 2 | not under command |
| 3 | restricted manoeuvrability |
| 4 | constrained by her draught |
| 5 | moored |
| 6 | aground |
| 7 | engaged in fishing |
| 8 | under way sailing |
| 9 | reserved for future uses |
| 10 | reserved for future uses |
| 11 | reserved for future uses |
| 12 | reserved for future uses |
| 13 | reserved for future uses |
| 14 | AIS-SART \(active\) |
| 15 | Not defined \(also used by AIS SART under test\) |

### QR19-1 Can the navigational status be automatically set on the Inland AIS device?

Keeping the navigational status always up to date is a kind of cumbersome. That’s why some Inland ECDIS devices support the setting of the navigational status by a special reminder which appears on the Inland ECDIS screen when the navigational status needs to be changed potentially with an automatic setting as well. However, the boatmaster needs to check the proposed setting of the navigational status anyway, a navigational status “moored” instead of “under way using engine” makes a difference eventually.

The responsibility of the boatmaster is to ensure that the Inland AIS device transmits up to date navigational status.

## QR20 How do I set the Reference point for the positional information aboard the vessel?

The area occupied by the vessel is provided with reference to the Inland AIS device’s GPS antenna, which is the point for the positional information aboard the vessel. The values A, B, C and D provides the distance from the GPS antenna to the bow \(A\), the stern \(B\), the port side \(C\) and the starboard side \(D\) of the vessel.

**A\) Input of Values A, B, C and D during installation**

The values A, B, C and D are entered with an accuracy of 1 m during the installation of the Inland AIS device by the approved specialised firm. The overall length and beam of the vessel is input with an accuracy of 0.1 m.

In cases where the vessel is not a convoy those values do not change. No further action by the boatmaster is required.

![](../.gitbook/assets/1%20%282%29.png)

Figure A

Figure A\): The position of the GPS antenna on the vessel is input during installation \(values A, B, D, C refers from the GPS antenna to the outline of the vessel\)

**B\) Input of Values A, B, C and D in case of a convoy**

In case of a convoy the values A, B, C and D needs to be changed when the setting of the convoy is changed. The A, B, C and D value always represents the overall area occupied by the vessel which includes the pusher and all connected barges.

The boatmaster needs to amend the A, B, C, D values accordingly in the Inland AIS device when the outline of the convoy is changed.

There are two different procedures to change those values depending on the age of the Inland AIS device.

**B1\) Input of Values A, B, C and D in Inland AIS devices installed before december 1st 2015**

For Inland AIS devices which are installed before December 1st 2015 \(type approval number R-4-200 to R-4-222\) the boatmaster needs to change the A, B, C, D values according the outline of the convoy with an accuracy of 1 m. The overall length and beam need to be input with the accuracy of 0,1 m.

Admittedly this is a kind of cumbersome for which reason some Inland ECDIS devices offer a special configuration menu to support the input of those data.

![](../.gitbook/assets/2%20%281%29.png)

Figure B1:

Figure B1 : The A, B, C, D value representing the position of the GPS antenna on the convoy needs to be amended by the boatmaster whenever the setting of the convoy is changed to reflect the overall contour of the convoy \(values A, B, D, C refers from the GPS antenna to the outline of the vessel\).

This applies to Inland AIS devices which are installed before December 1st 2015 \(type approval number R-4-200 to R-4-222\).

**B1\) Input of Values A, B, C and D in Inland AIS device installed after December 1st 2015**

All Inland AIS devices which are installed after December 1st 2015 \(type approval number R-4-300 to R-4-3xx\) the boatmaster does not needs to change the A, B, C, D values directly according the change of the outline of the convoy. Instead, the values for the extension to the push tow caused by the barges shall be input.

These values in metre with an accuracy of 0.1m are:

* EA: the extension in front of the of the push tow or tug,
* EB: the extension at the rear,
* EC: The Extension at the starboard side \(EC\),
* ED: The extension at the port side.

The overall length and beam are calculated automatically accordingly and transmitted by the Inland AIS device.

![A picture containing diagram

Description automatically generated](../.gitbook/assets/3%20%281%29.png)

Figure B2

Here as well some Inland ECDIS devices offer a special configuration menu to support the input of those data.

Those values must be input by the boatmaster whenever the convoy is changed. This applies to Inland AIS device which are installed after December 1st 2015 \(type approval number R-4-300 to R-4-3xx\).

## QR21 What is an electronic chart display system??

As defined in the CCNR resolution 2014-I-12, the expression “electronic chart display system” it is referring either to:

- an Inland ECDIS device in information mode

 - or a comparable device for displaying electronic charts.

These systems include in particular software that is an application that shows

*  electronic charts

When the system is connected to an AIS device, additionally, the software indicates:

* on the chart vessel’s own position
* position and movement of other vessels
* information about other vessels
* alarm messages from AIS \(only for Inland ECDIS in information mode\)

These systems may show additional other information. To make full use of the Inland ECDIS in information mode or a comparable device for displaying electronic charts it has to fulfil minimum requirements. Minimum requirements to be complied with have been defined so as to ensure correct operation of the Inland ECDIS device in information mode or a comparable electronic chart display device. Recommendations have been drawn up by way of addition. On the Rhine, the minimum requirements are defined according to the Resolution 2014-I-12.

https://ccr-zkr.org/files/documents/ris/prot2014I12en\_Annexe2.pdf

When connected to a radar, Inland ECDIS is in navigation mode and may be used for navigation purpose. Therefore, Inland ECDIS in navigation mode has to fulfil higher requirements.

## QR22 Why is it useful to have an electronic chart display system on board of my vessel?

Electronic chart display systems are the combination of hardware and software to display electronic inland navigation charts

Electronic chart display systems are a system for the display of electronic charts for inland navigation. Its purpose is to contribute to the safety and efficiency of inland navigation and thus also to the protection of the environment.

Inland AIS device enables the communication of information from vessel to vessel as well as from vessel to shore and vice versa. With the help of shore based AIS repeater stations, even information from vessels out-of-sight can be received, especially in mountainous sections.

Only a dedicated electronic chart display system with a screen, large enough to show all relevant details, makes full use of the potential given by Inland AIS device.

In addition, ECDIS device in information mode may provide additional functions show alarms of connected devices like Inland AIS.

## QR23 Obligation of equipment with an Inland ECDIS device or a comparable device for displaying electronic charts

Vessels that are subject to the obligation of equipment with an Inland AIS device, pursuant to article 4.07 of the Rhine Police Regulations, must also be equipped with an ECDIS device in information mode or a comparable **device for displaying electronic charts** connected with the Inland AIS device.

Moreover, they are required to use it in conjunction with an up-to-date electronic inland navigation chart. That means that the skipper must have installed the latest available version of the chart.

This mandatory possession of the equipment does not apply to:

* vessels that are not subject to mandatory possession of an AIS device \(QR5\)
* ferries.

According to article 1.01, \(l\) of the Rhine Police Regulations, a ferry is a vessel providing a service crossing the waterway and which is classified as a ferry by the competent authority.

## QR24 What to do in the event of an electronic chart display system no longer able to display Inland AIS device information?

The electronic chart display system shall operate reliably and be in good working order.

In case of malfunction, switching off and restarting the electronic chart display system and the Inland AIS device could help recover the good working order.

If the electronic chart display system is malfunctioning, this may cause misjudgements and uncertainty on the waterway.

A voyage undertaken with a defective Inland ECDIS device engages the responsibility of the skipper.

As a defective electronic chart display system should be the exception to the rule, the [CCNR](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/) recommends that the riparian states of the Rhine apply the following flexibility rules:

* Navigation may be continued for a maximum period of 48 hours with an electronic chart display system that does not allow Inland AIS device data to be displayed. This flexibility enables the next port of loading or unloading to be reached or, failing that, if this port is too far away, a place where repair or replacement of the defective devices can be affected.
* No voyage shall be commenced without an electronic chart display system in good working order and operating, failing which the 48-hour grace period would lapse.
* Given the special nature of voyages undertaken by day-trip vessels, the two preceding paragraphs do not apply to these vessels. For a day-trip vessel, navigation may be continued for a maximum period of 48 hours with an electronic chart display system that does not allow AIS device data to be displayed.

## QR25 On the Rhine, what are the minimum requirements for electronic chart display systems?

[CCNR](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/) passed [resolution](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/13020400-en.html) 2013-II-16 making it compulsory to possess and use the Inland AIS device with effect from 1st December 2014.

Minimum requirements to be complied with have been defined so as to ensure correct operation of the Inland ECDIS device in information mode or a comparable electronic chart display device. Recommendations have been drawn up by way of addition.

The [minimum requirements for electronic chart display system](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/files/documents/ris/prot2014I12en_Annexe2.pdf) were adopted by [Resolution](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/13020400-en.html) 2014-I-12.

The [document](https://www.ccr-zkr.org/files/documents/ris/prot2014I12en_Annexe2.pdf) contains minimum requirements for the use, the display of information and the software:

Remark : Inland ECDIS in navigation mode means that the device is connected to a radar system, which limits the range, unless one continuously switches over while navigating, which is not desirable either.

## QR26 Is it prescribed to connect the blue sign to the Inland AIS?

Connecting the blue panel to the Inland AIS device is not prescribed.

The connection of the blue panel to the Inland AIS device is handled very differently. When going about their navigational duties, skippers must be aware that certain vessels have connected the blue panel to the Inland AIS device and others not, with the result that the situation displayed on the electronic chart does not necessarily correspond to the actual situation.

## QR27 Is it permitted using Inland ECDIS in navigation mode?

Yes, although Inland ECDIS device in navigation mode is accepted to fulfill the obligation of equipment with Inland ECDIS device in information mode or comparable electronic chart display systems, it is recommended to have beside the Inland ECDIS device in navigation mode an additional and separate Inland ECDIS device in information mode or a comparable device for displaying electronic charts. to prevent switching between different ranges in navigation mode.

### Operation of Inland ECDIS device in information mode

In the information mode, an Inland ECDIS device acts as an electronic atlas and serves to guide and to provide information about the waterway.

Inland ECDIS in information mode is typically used in ranges of 2 000 m and more. When connected to a positioning sensor the chart picture can be adjusted automatically in a way that the vessel's own position is fixed in the centre of the screen. It is also possible to display other vessels, which are equipped with Inland AIS device, if the application is connected to an Inland AIS device.

Inland ECDIS device are destined for the information mode only, the requirements of the Inland ECDIS Standard are to be understood as a recommendation. Only the minimum requirements defined in the CCNR resolution 2014-I-12 apply.

It is not mandatory that a comparable device for displaying electronic charts has the above-mentioned functions,

### Operation of Inland ECDIS device in navigation mode

Navigation mode means the use of the Inland ECDIS device for conning the vessel by using radar and underlaid chart image \(Inland ENC\).

Inland ECDIS equipment being able to operate in the navigation mode means radar equipment as defined by the regulations concerning the minimum requirements and test conditions for radar installations used for Rhine navigation and requires type approval. The vessel’s position must be derived from a continuous positioning system whose accuracy is consistent with the requirements of safe navigation.

Anyone, who uses an Inland ECDIS device in the navigation mode, must have a radar license.

Inland ECDIS in navigation mode shall be operated in an appropriate radar range \(on the Rhine: typically, 800 m / 1 200 m\).

## QR28 Voyage-Checklist

[This](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LzkduvER3ZWneEYq38_%2F-MFd8t_jcer6hpFXDfTm%2F-MFdAWpSlYUGcplX5Ec_%2Fchecklist.pdf?alt=media&token=bc218ea3-10d4-4131-b799-707cca9b717b) page references checklists to be used during voyage to fulfil the obligations of carriage and use of Inland AIS. Note that these checklists are examples and not exhaustive and that they could always be completed according to regional regulations.

This checklist should help the boatmaster operate the Inland AIS device on board the vessel. The purpose is to give a short overview of what kind of data should be input and kept up to date during the voyage of the inland vessel. The current minimum requirement of the data input may differ between regions. The minimum requirements of the data content are published in the appropriate regional regulation of the river commission or the national legislation.

Before the voyage starts, check that the Inland AIS device is switched on.

**Before the voyage**

Check your own vessel data transmitted by the Inland AIS device \(once in a while\):

* Name of the vessel.
* ENI number.
* ERI vessel and convoy type.
* Length and beam of vessel.
* Reference point of the GPS antenna.
* If blue sign is connected, check
  * that blue sign status is correct.
* Check if you are receiving data from other vessels \(which you may see visually\) on the electronic chart display systems

**Shortly before starting the voyage**

Amend your own vessel’s data for the planned voyage according to the regional regulation for the waterway where you are navigating:

* Dangerous cargo indication.
* Destination.
* Depth.
* In case of convoy:
  * Length and
  * beam of convoy and the reference point of the GPS antenna. Also, if the previous voyage was a convoy it should be adjusted accordingly.
* Set the navigational status information of the vessel to “underway” with respect to the navigational status that is applicable.

**During the voyage**

* Keep the navigational status information of the vessel up to date.
* Check if you are receiving data from other vessels \(which you may see visually\).

**After the voyage**

* Set the navigational status information to “moored” or “at anchor”.
* Amend the voyage-related data if necessary.
* Operate the Inland AIS device according to the regional regulation for the waterway/port of navigation.
