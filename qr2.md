# What is an Inland AIS device?

The Automatic Identification System \(AIS\) device is a transponder providing automatic communication and identification system intended to improve the safety of navigation by assisting in the efficient operation of vessel traffic services \(VTS\), ship reporting, ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore operations. The Automatic Identification System \(AIS\) has been first used for maritime navigation and is now in operation for inland navigation since 2010 on the Rhine. It is an automatic tracking system on board vessels that provides vessel information to other vessels and to shore organisation such as river information service \(RIS\) centres. Reversely, the AIS device also gathers information from other vessels and shore organisations.

The transfer of information is done via Inland AIS devices on board vessels. Inland AIS devices integrate electronic sensors such as a global positioning system \(GPS\), to capture real-time positioning of vessel, and a Very High Frequency \(VHF\) transceiver, to transmit data in both directions.
