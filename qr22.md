# Why is it useful to have an electronic chart display system on board of my vessel?

Electronic chart display systems are the combination of hardware and software to display electronic inland navigation charts.

Electronic chart display systems are a system for the display of electronic charts for inland navigation. Its purpose is to contribute to the safety and efficiency of inland navigation and thus also to the protection of the environment.

Inland AIS device enables the communication of information from vessel to vessel as well as from vessel to shore and vice versa. With the help of shore based AIS repeater stations, even information from vessels out-of-sight can be received, especially in mountainous sections.

Only a dedicated electronic chart display system with a screen, large enough to show all relevant details, makes full use of the potential given by Inland AIS device.

In addition, ECDIS device in information mode may provide additional functions show alarms of connected devices like Inland AIS.
